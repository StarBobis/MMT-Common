# MMT-Common

This is a dependency project for MigotoModTool (MMT-Community).

(Only tested and support Release X64)

# How to build

MMT-Common need MMT-Utils to work, so you need to build MMT-Utils first, see: 
https://github.com/StarBobis/MMT-Utils/blob/master/README.md

Then add include path to MMT-Utils's location,add lib path to MMT-Utils\x64\Release,and then you can build MMT-Common.

notice: due to project seperate, MMT-Common also need add include and lib path for Boost.
